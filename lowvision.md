# Low Vision
| Design consderation | Why?     
| ------------- |:-------------:|  
| The pinch to zoom feature must not be disabled (avoid <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no" /> | When zooming is disabled on a webpage, which the parameter `user-scalable=no` does, low vision users who use screen magnifiers to read content may be unable to properly see information on a web page |
| *All text must pass contrast guidelines against the background (verify using Deque's aXe accessibility browser extension) *| Some users who have low vision may see in low contrast. So, text, readers, and other elements may appear as the same or similiar shades of brightness to them. Textual elements that are to close in brightness to background colors may be extremely diffcult to read for these users. |
| *Links, buttons, and controls must have a visible `:focus` state and a visible `:hover` state.*| Some low vision users may use a keyboard or mouse, or both as input methods. Having visible `:focus` and `:hover` states helps users to know where the keyboard / mouse focus is on a web page. The default browsers `:focus` state is acceptable per the WCAG guidelines, but users with low vision benefit greatly from enhanced CSS`:focus` and `:hover` states.
|The user interface should provide a clear visual distinction between content(e.g.,text) and controls(e.g., buttons, links, etc). | Users who may see low contrast may have diffculty distinguishing whether controls are actionable on a web page because these elements may blend together with surrounding text and background colors.
