A cheat sheet and notes for accessibility 

## Focus
Focus determines where keyboard events go in the page <br>
Input, button, and dropdowns have are implicitly focusable. They are already in the tab order + keyboard event handling.<br>

**Not all elements are focusable**
Headers, p tags and images are not focusable.<br> Which is by design, since most cases they will not be interactable.
> tab = move focus forward <br>
> shift + tab = move focus backwards <br>
> arrow keys = moves focus within a component
